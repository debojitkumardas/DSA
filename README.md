# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

This repository contains implementations of commonly used data structures and algorithms in various programming languages. Each implementation is thoroughly documented using Doxygen-style comments for clarity and ease of understanding.

## Contents

1. [Data Structures](./datastructures)
   - [Stack](./datastructures/stack)
   - [Queue](./datastructures/queue)
   - [Graph](./datastructures/graph)

2. [Algorithms](./algorithms)
   - [Linear Search](./algorithms/binary_search)
   - [Binary Search](./algorithms/binary_search)
   - [Depth First Search](./algorithms/DFS)
   - [Breadth First Search](./algorithms/BFS)

## Languages

Currently the implementation is provided in:
   - C++

## Documentation

Each source file contains detailed comments using Doxygen-style documentation. These comments include descriptions of the algorithms, explanations of key data structures, time complexity analysis, and usage examples where applicable. This ensures that the code is not only functional but also educational and easy to integrate into other projects.

## Usage

To use any of the data structures or algorithms:
   1. Clone the repository:
   `git@github.com:debojitkumardas/DSA.git`
   2. Navigate to the desired implementation directory
   3. Compile (if necessary) and run the code according to the instructions provided in the README files within each directory.
