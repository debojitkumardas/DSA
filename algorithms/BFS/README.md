# BFS Overview

Breadth First Search (DFS) is one of the most fundamental search algorithm used to explore nodes and edges of a graph. It's often used as a building block in other algorithms. The BFS algorithm is particularly useful for finding shortest path on unweighted graph.

Important metrics:
    - Time Complexity O(V + E)
    - ...
